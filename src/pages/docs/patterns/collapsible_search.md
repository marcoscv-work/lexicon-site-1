## Usage

This pattern is commonly used when a search text filed placed in a bar gets to a mobile resolution. It can be the case of a navbar, or a management bar.

#### Not collapsing navbar entries

Sometimes you might want to have your navigation entries always visible in the navbar because they are few option. In this case, this is the variation you have to use,

#### Collapsing Navbar entries

There will be cases when you will have many entries in the Navbar and collapsing it would create a Navbar with more than one line. You must use this variation to keep the consistency.
