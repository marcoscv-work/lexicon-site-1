## Definition
Spinners show the user that an external process, like a connection, is being executed.

## Usage

This feedback mechanism is essential for the user to understand that something is happening. Please remember to include when there is a connection to a server and the same screen shows the answer to the user.

Please donâ€™t use spinners inside buttons. In case you need a spinner for an action triggered by a button, place the spinner to one of the sides of the button.
